# Submit_ThreatGrid_Sample
Python script to submit files to ThreatGrid bulk sample submit api. 

This isn't anything fancy, it just submits and gives you some samaple info; you won't get the status/results of your submission.

It submits the samples as Private and doesn't do anything else extra; you may want to set up the default scanning defaults/options for the account that is tied to the API key below. 


To make this script work, you'll need to add some things:

tg_api_key - this is the API key for the account that has an API key in TG.
