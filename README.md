# Submit_ThreatGrid_Sample
Python script to submit files to CIS Malicious Code Analysis Platform (MCAP: https://mcap.cisecurity.org/about) bulk sample submit api.

This isn't anything fancy, it just submits and gives you some sample info; you won't get the status/results of your submission.

To make this script work, you'll need to add some things:

tg_api_key - this is the API key for the account that has an API key in MCAP.
